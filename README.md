# RegistRAWR

A destributed registry for DApp frontends built on Ethereum and IPFS.

The goal of registRAWR is to provide a distributed way of accessing OpenSource frontends for dapps. While the smart contracts themselves cannot be taken down or censored frontend and hosting is still vulnerable. RegistRAWR aims to solve that problem by ustilizing distributed technologies to guarantee access to dapp frontends.
